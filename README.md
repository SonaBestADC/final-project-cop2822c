# COP 2822C Final Project
---
### What is this?
This is a simple website I made in a day for my COP 2822C final project. 

I used my friend's restaurant to model my website off of.

I choose to do the project in React so I made the github to host the project for my professor.

### Other Info
----------------
I made 5 working pages those are:
- Welcome page
- About Us page
- Our Menu page
- Contact Us page
- Error page

The Event, Reservations, and Admin buttons on the navigation menu redirect to the error page.
There are also two external links to a facebook page and yelp page at the footer.

Ignore the build folder that is used for hosting the website on GitHub Pages.

### To use:
---
1. Run npm install 
2. Run npm start
